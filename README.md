Battle Plan

This software comes with no warranty. Use it at your own risk.

The goal of this project is to create an easy to setup and easy to run personal map server package. The software I have written comes with no license. Software created by others may or may not. Use it any way you wish. The server itself requires nodejs. It is recommended that required packages be installed using https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-install-all. It is highly recommended that the server be run in HTTPS mode.
